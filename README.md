Regarding the java stuff, you want to make sure that your installed java is the same bit version as R. Basically if R is x64 make sure java is too. You can check for R with sessionInfo(). Then in the line of code in the middle of my library codes, just make sure it has the path to wherever java is installed on your computer. Then everything should work fine.
